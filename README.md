# Game Of Life PHP

This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in PHP.
This took about 15 minutes to make. Might be buggy?

## Installation

Clone the repository and run `composer install` to install the dependencies.

## Usage

Run `php src/gameoflife.php` to run the game.
Inside that file you can set the template from "random" to "Blinker" or "Spaceship".

Also you can set the delay between each generation in line `37` in microseconds.

## License

You can do whatever you want with this code. I don't care.
